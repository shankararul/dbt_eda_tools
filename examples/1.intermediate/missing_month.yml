  - name: missing_month
    description: The 'missing_month' model is designed to filter out specific data
      from the 'data_generator' model. It selects distinct company names,
      countries, and the month part of the date from the 'data_generator' table.
      The model then filters out data for specific companies in specific
      countries for specific date ranges. For example, it filters out data for
      the company 'FB' in the country 'CA' for the date range between
      '2019-05-01' and '2019-07-05'. It also filters out data for all companies
      for the date range between '2022-05-01' and '2022-08-05'. Additionally, it
      filters out data for all companies in the country 'DE' for the date range
      between '2019-09-07' and '2019-11-09'. Finally, it filters out data for
      the company 'AMZN' for the date range between '2019-01-07' and
      '2019-09-09'. The output of the model is the remaining data after these
      filters have been applied.
